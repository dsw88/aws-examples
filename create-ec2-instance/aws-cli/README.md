# AWS CLI Example
Simple example of using the AWS CLI to create and destroy an EC2 instance

# Bash
## Example Usage
To run this example, just invoke the bash script from this directory:
```
./bash/create-instance.sh
```

# Other Platforms
I haven't currently implemented this example for any other technology or platform
(PowerShell, etc.). I welcome anyone who wants to contribute this
example in another technology.

If I ever have the time myself I'll probably add a few more language examples
