# Console Tutorials
A small collection of walkthrough tutorials showing basics on starting to use some AWS services

The following tutorials are currently available:

* [Create Instance](create-instance.md)

# Adding More Tutorials
I welcome contributions for more console tutorials for other common EC2 actions and for other services like S3, RDS, etc. Any tutorials you add should be clear and concise, and should contain images to help illustrate concepts.
